# TrumpTweetWordCloud
Using TwitterAPI, Node.JS and Python, a Word Cloud of Trump's Tweets is generated into the shape of Donald Trump.

This project was used to gain some experience with:
1. Python and using libraries.
2. Javascript, Node.JS
3. TwitterAPI

Javascript and Node.JS were used as the Trumpbot.js file was built for a website to call the script and Node is used to test it without having a server.
